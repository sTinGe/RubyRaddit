Lession 1: LINK SUBMISSIONS

To have the ability to submit a link, we are going to generate a scaffold for our Links… Lets do that now

Lession 2: Users
Next, we want to have the ability to have users sign up, as well as sign in & out and edit their accounts. For this, we’re going to use a Gem called Devise
First, lets create a new branch. If you haven’t realized already, its good practice to create a new branch for anything that you do, that way if you mess up you can revert back and not affect the master branch.
